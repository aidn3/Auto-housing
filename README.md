#### Auto-Promote @aidn5  
automating [Owner] and [Co-Owner] jobs from giving [Rank] after completing a parkour course till giving the opportunity to guests to save the place for later visit.  
It works by reading messages from the server/chat and detecting if it has to trigger (e.g /group [rank] add [name])  
 
#### HousingSaver @bugfroggy  
This mod allows users to automatically save their place using chat commands.  
It saves player's position after sending a private message to the owner ("/msg [OwnerName] !save")  
It works by using regex to read the chat and detect it  
 
#### Anti-Griefer @aidn5  
It prevent people from griefing the plot. It needs owner permission to work(NOT Co-Owner).  
This project still in progress. All I can say is:  
It needs a LOT of MATHs, knowledge of 3D dimension, multiple threads and advanced java classes. Not even sure if I can do it in minecraft version 1.8.9.
